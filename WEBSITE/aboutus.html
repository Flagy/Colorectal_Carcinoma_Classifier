    <p class="card-text card text-white bg-info mb-3 font-weight-bold font-italic">  "You don't need to predict the future. Just choose a future -- a good future, a useful future -- and make the kind of prediction that will alter human emotions and reactions in such a way that the future you predicted will be brought about. Better to make a good future than predict a bad one." ~ Isaac Asimov
