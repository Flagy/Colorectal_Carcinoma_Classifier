This folder contains all file to launch website.
First of all:
  1- Download WEBSITE Folder
  2- In network folder download the folder network from the link provided in the txt file and put all file in WEBSITE/network/ (very important)
  3- In server.py 
    +- Change IP ADDRESS and Port according to your machine (It would be useful to add a json config file)
    +- Launch the script in command line give "python server.py [Abs Path]" where Abs PAth is the absolute path which the folder website is stored
      we would have something like "C:\Users\frana\Desktop\WEBSITE"
    +- After the script will be launched, go on your browser on "http://IPAddress:port/index.html". If all goes right you will see the main page of the site.
    
Please let me know if it works. 
Ciao
